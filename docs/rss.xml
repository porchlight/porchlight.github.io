     <description><![CDATA[<p>Not actually my grandma&#39;s recipe, but they encompass the best part about them, <strong>YOU CANN RIP THEM APART WITHOUT A KNIFE YOU WEAK LOSER.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="/images/tore.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>yeah man, thats why I like them. I&#39;ve seen them called pull-apart buns, or cloverleaf buns. anyways here&#39;s my recipe:</p>
<p>Get 2 big bowls</p>
<p><strong>In one bowl:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.5 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
<li>1.5 teaspons salt</li>
<li>mix that together</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In other bowl:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspons of instant yeast - you can use active yeast or whatever too, this is just easier and what i have used</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of softened butter</li>
<li>1 cup + 2.5 tablespoons of Warm milk</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the 2 bowls ready to go, start pouring the flour/salt bowl into the other bowl about a cup at a time and mixing with a wooden spoon or something. </p>
<p>Once you have all the shit combined, just keep mixing with the wooden spoon until it&#39;s really sticky. </p>
<p>Then wash your hands, roll up your sleeves, and put your hands in there and just keep rolling it around and folding it in on itself for like 5 minutes or until it looks and acts like dough. </p>
<p>Wash the now empty bowl and dry it off, then grease it up with some butter or pam or something. </p>
<p>Take your doughball and throw it in the greased bowl and put a damp dish drying towel over the bowl and put it somewhere warmish in your house. </p>
<p>Let it sit for 60-90 minutes.</p>
<p>Grab a muffin tray (12 spots), grease up the holes by rubbing some margerine or butter around in them with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Take out your dough bowl and throw it down on a surface witha bit of flour, roll it around. </p>
<p>Then you need to chop this focker up into 12 equally sized balls. I usually chop it into 3 equal pieces, then from each of those I chop them into 4. SO I have 12 ballssssss. Then I cut each in half, then each of those pieces i fold a bit into a ball. Then place 2 balss in each place in the muffin tray! </p>
<p>Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls</p>

<p>Lay your dish towel on top of the rack and let it chill for another hour.</p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350. Take off the towel and put the buns in the oven for 22 minutes.</p>
<p>Melt some butter, take the buns out and then brush some butter on top of them. <strong>DONE</strong></p>
<p>Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls</p>
