     <title>Asian stir fry thing</title>

     <guid>/posts/asian-stir-fry-thing.html</guid>
     <description><![CDATA[<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Asian really, but it has soy sauce in it. I like to prep this one at lunch and let it marinate until I&#39;m ready to cook for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Serves 2 people.</strong></p>
<p>Put all this stuff into a medium size bowl, something you can seal shut, or just put glad wrap on to keep air tight if possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts chopped into cubes</li>
<li>2 cloves of minced garlic</li>
<li>shred a chunk of ginger in there the size of your thumb</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or any salt)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, mix that stuff all together and throw it covered into the fridge for a couple hours if possible. If you don&#39;t have time to marinate it probably doesn&#39;t even matter (maybe it does, I have no idea I&#39;m not a food doctor), I just like getting this step out of the way so it&#39;s less to do later.</p>
<p><strong>Prep to cook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the meal takes about 10 minutes to cook once you start the burner, so you should start your rice to accommodate for that (I buy big boxes of Minute Rice brown rice (pic below) and just microwave a cup of rice, and a cup of water for 10 minutes, so easy)</li>
<li>chunk up at least half a head of broccoli</li>
<li>at least 1 pepper (red, yellow, or orange) sliced, not diced</li>
<li>maybe 2-3 &quot;discs&quot; of red onion, sliced not diced (you know what a disc is, don&#39;t give me that)</li>
<li>crush 15 almonds or peanuts or cashews (I usually put them in a ziplock and beat it up)</li>
<li>have ready to add: soy sauce, red pepper flakes, peanut butter, sriracha </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time to cook:</strong></p>
<p>In a large pan (I like a wok for this, or something cast iron), heat up a 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil (canola oil if you don&#39;t have sesame, or any oil I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about Im not a food scientist). Heat it on high, like 8.5/10. Once that&#39;s heated up (you can flick water at it and it sizzles) chuck your whole marinated mixture of crap in there and stir it around for a minute or two, until the chicken is starting to brown.</p>
<p>Next you want to throw in the broccoli, peppers, onions, stir that around for a minute or two.</p>
<p>Once you think everything is more or less cooked you can add the rest of the ingredients and stir around. I will typically add I don&#39;t know a tablespoon of soy sauce, a tablespoon of peanut butter, maybe a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of sriracha but really the amount of those ingredients depends on what you want. Add more soy sauce for a saltier flavour, peanut butter for more sweetness, red pepper flakes and sriracha for more heat. I&#39;ve never actually measured these ingredients, I just throw them in an taste as I go. Anyways mix all that up, stir around for another minute or two until it&#39;s all cooked and mixed through. It should be sort of sticky/chunky at this point. Serve it on top of the rice, <strong>done!</strong></p>
<p>Should end up looking kinda like this</p>

     <title>Ranchero Wrap</title>
     <link>/posts/ranchero-wrap.html</link>
     <guid>/posts/ranchero-wrap.html</guid>
     <description><![CDATA[<p>So this is my take on an overpriced wrap I used to pay for almost weekly when working in office downtown. Place was called &quot;Salad Bowl&quot;, the wrap is called the &quot;Ranchero Wrap&quot;. This is my copycat recipe, feeds 2:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 large tortilla wraps</li>
<li>1 big or 2 small chicken breast</li>
<li>2 discs of red onion (more or less) diced</li>
<li>half a tomato diced</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1/2 cup of cheddar cheese</li>
<li>iceberg lettuce (enough for 2 big macs) I measure iceberg lettuce in big macs</li>
<li>tsp chilli powder</li>
<li>ranch dressing or creaming dressing (pictured)</li>
<li>optional - bacon crumble</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/creamy.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Pre-prep:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cube 1 big or 2 small chicken breast</li>
<li>brown that in a non-stick in olive oil, salt, and pepper a couple hours before dinner, I usually do this at lunch.</li>
<li>put it in a bowl or something covered with saran wrap, and put in the fridge to cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you do, just make sure the chicken is cold. This is a cold wrappopp buddy. You don&#39;t want no moist chicken chunks, it tastes like eating a petri dish.</p>
<p>So you and your chicken (c)hunks, you&#39;re almost done. </p>
<p><strong>The prep:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>throw down your tortilla wrap on some tinfoil if you fancy</li>
<li>put half the chicken clumps down on each</li>
<li>line with ranch dressing, or garlic parm dressing</li>
<li>sprinkle a 1/2 tsp or so of chilli powder on each</li>
<li>sprinkle half the cheese, half the tomato, the onion, lettuce, and avocado on each</li>
<li>wrap&#39;em up bro! <strong>DONE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re lucky it&#39;ll look something like this image I stole from google images:</p>

     <title>ANIMA - Wheat</title>
     <link>/posts/02.html</link>
     <guid>/posts/02.html</guid>
     <description><![CDATA[<p>Anything this ANIMA person does rules. I find it so calming, but at the same time so anxious and energizing. A lot of it has recognizable riddims, or lyrics but altered to the point where it&#39;s not always obvious upon first listen. This would be my favourite genre if it were one, but it&#39;s literally just this person as far as I know. And surprising I like it even though there are barely any drums. Hook me up in the comments if you know something else close to this! </p>

     <title>Grandma&apos;s buns</title>
     <link>/posts/01.html</link>
     <guid>/posts/01.html</guid>
     <description><![CDATA[<p>Not actually my grandma&#39;s recipe, but they encompass the best part about them, <strong>YOU CANN RIP THEM APART WITHOUT A KNIFE YOU WEAK LOSER.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="/images/tore.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>yeah man, thats why I like them. I&#39;ve seen them called pull-apart buns, or cloverleaf buns. anyways here&#39;s my recipe:</p>
<p>Get 2 big bowls</p>
<p><strong>In one bowl:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.5 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
<li>1.5 teaspons salt</li>
<li>mix that together</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In other bowl:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspons of instant yeast - you can use active yeast or whatever too, this is just easier and what i have used</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of softened butter</li>
<li>1 cup + 2.5 tablespoons of Warm milk</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the 2 bowls ready to go, start pouring the flour/salt bowl into the other bowl about a cup at a time and mixing with a wooden spoon or something. </p>
<p>Once you have all the shit combined, just keep mixing with the wooden spoon until it&#39;s really sticky. </p>
<p>Then wash your hands, roll up your sleeves, and put your hands in there and just keep rolling it around and folding it in on itself for like 5 minutes or until it looks and acts like dough. </p>
<p>Wash the now empty bowl and dry it off, then grease it up with some butter or pam or something. </p>
<p>Take your doughball and throw it in the greased bowl and put a damp dish drying towel over the bowl and put it somewhere warmish in your house. </p>
<p>Let it sit for 60-90 minutes.</p>
<p>Grab a muffin tray (12 spots), grease up the holes by rubbing some margerine or butter around in them with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Take out your dough bowl and throw it down on a surface witha bit of flour, roll it around. </p>
<p>Then you need to chop this focker up into 12 equally sized balls. I usually chop it into 3 equal pieces, then from each of those I chop them into 4. SO I have 12 ballssssss. Then I cut each in half, then each of those pieces i fold a bit into a ball. Then place 2 balss in each place in the muffin tray! </p>
<p>Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls</p>
<p><img src="/images/buns.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lay your dish towel on top of the rack and let it chill for another hour.</p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350. Take off the towel and put the buns in the oven for 22 minutes.</p>
<p>Melt some butter, take the buns out and then brush some butter on top of them. <strong>DONE</strong></p>
<p>Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls</p>
