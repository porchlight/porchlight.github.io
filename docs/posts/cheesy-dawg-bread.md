There's a place in London called the Dawghouse, their garlic bread rules and this recipe reminds me of theirs.

* preheat oven to 425

**In a mixing bowl mix this stuff together**

* 1 cup of shredded cheese (cheddar, mozza, marble, or a combo of cheeses whatever you want)
* 1/4 cup mayo
* 3 garlic gloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons grated parm (or pecorino romano)
* 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
* pinch of kosher salt
* pinch of ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons of parsley (I just use dried parsley flakes, so I do slightly less than 2 full tablespoons)

**Bread**

You can use whatever you want, a baguette, a couple sub buns, hot dog/hamburg buns. I prefer taking 2 sub buns, cutting them in half lengthwise. I feel thats the traditional pub style.

Whatever bread you go with, spread some margarine on there, or don't, I don't care. Im a pig, so I do this.

**SO now you just spread your mixture out on your bread vessel.**
