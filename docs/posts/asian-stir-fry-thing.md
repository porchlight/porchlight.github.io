I don't know if it's Asian really, but it has soy sauce in it. I like to prep this one at lunch and let it marinate until I'm ready to cook for dinner.

**Serves 2 people.**

Put all this stuff into a medium size bowl, something you can seal shut, or just put glad wrap on to keep air tight if possible:

* 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts chopped into cubes
* 2 cloves of minced garlic
* shred a chunk of ginger in there the size of your thumb
* 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or any salt)
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper

So yeah, mix that stuff all together and throw it covered into the fridge for a couple hours if possible. If you don't have time to marinate it probably doesn't even matter (maybe it does, I have no idea I'm not a food doctor), I just like getting this step out of the way so it's less to do later.

**Prep to cook:**

* the meal takes about 10 minutes to cook once you start the burner, so you should start your rice to accommodate for that (I buy big boxes of Minute Rice brown rice (pic below) and just microwave a cup of rice, and a cup of water for 10 minutes, so easy)
* chunk up at least half a head of broccoli
* at least 1 pepper (red, yellow, or orange) sliced, not diced
* maybe 2-3 "discs" of red onion, sliced not diced
* crush 15 almonds or peanuts or cashews (I usually put them in a ziplock and beat it up)
* have ready to add: soy sauce, red pepper flakes, peanut butter, sriracha 

**Time to cook:**

In a large pan (I like a wok for this, or something cast iron), heat up a 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil (canola oil if you don't have sesame, or any oil I have no idea what I'm talking about Im not a food scientist). Heat it on high, like 8.5/10. Once that's heated up (you can flick water at it and it sizzles) chuck your whole marinated mixture of crap in there and stir it around for a minute or two, until the chicken is starting to brown.

Next you want to throw in the broccoli, peppers, onions, stir that around for a minute or two.

Once you think everything is more or less cooked you can add the rest of the ingredients and stir around. I will typically add I don't know a tablespoon of soy sauce, a tablespoon of peanut butter, maybe a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of sriracha but really the amount of those ingredients depends on what you want. Add more soy sauce for a saltier flavour, peanut butter for more sweetness, red pepper flakes and sriracha for more heat. I've never actually measured these ingredients, I just throw them in an taste as I go. Anyways mix all that up, stir around for another minute or two until it's all cooked and mixed through. It should be sort of sticky/chunky at this point. Serve it on top of the rice, **done!**

Should end up looking kinda like this
