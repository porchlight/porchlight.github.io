        <p><em>Posted on April 19, 2022 4:32 PM</em></p>
		<p>I call it new pizza because it has a different process than you are probably used to. You cook the the dough first on the stove top, then you cook the cheese and toppings under the broiler. So before you start this recipe make sure your oven has a broiler setting (maybe all do? I have no idea, i only started using it like this year and it rules for melting cheese). Anyways ahere we gooo</p>
<p>* recipe requires at least one frying pan you can put in the oven (cast iron is best)</p>
<p><strong>Dough recipe (makes 2 dough balls/pizzas)</strong></p>
<p>In a big bowl (we&#39;ll call it our <em>wet bowl)</em> mix:<br>1.5 cups of warm water<br>2 tablespoons sugar<br>1.5 teaspoons active dry yeast (sure other yeasts work, this is just the one I have used)<br>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>In another bowl (the <em>dry bowl</em>) mix:<br>3 cups AP flour<br>1 teaspoon salt<br><br>Now combine the stuff, I like to use a wooden spoon first, add the dry mix to the wet mix about a cup at a time and stir with the wooden spoon until its too hard cause youre a little wimpy loser. Once your forearms wuss out you can drop the spoon and then use your dirty hands and work it until its all mixed together in a sticky dough ball. Seriously the more you work it the better so fud with it for like 5 minutes. OR if you have a stand mixer you can just pour all this shit in there and whip it in there for 5 minutes. Anyways its dough, jus tdo it</p>
<p>so doughs mixed now. now grease a big bowl with some butter or non-stick, and throw the ball in there and cover with a damp towel and leave it in a warm area for an hour</p>
<p>It has risen like christ on either Easter or Christmas I don&#39;t know who cares, take it out of the greasy bowl and roll it around in a little flour. Once you have a nice little cooperative dough ball, cut it in half so you have 2 little cute little baby dough balls hehe.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Time</strong></p>
<p>In your oven safe frying pan drop in like a tablespoon ish of olive oil, pinch of each kosher salt, garlic salt, oregano, italian seasoning, and parsley. Rub it all around with your fingies or a brush, make sure you get the whole pan. </p>
<p>Now to stretch the dough ball into a circle to fit in the pan. I don&#39;t know how to do this very well, it sucks, you can try to do it in the air like you know what youre doing or you can just push it down and out for a while trying not to rip it, anyways you gotta get the dough ball into the pan to look like a real pizza, so battle with that until it&#39;s satisfactory. Here&#39;s what mine looked like.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pizza1.png" alt="Pizza dough"></p>
<p>Now here comes the &quot;new pizza&quot; part -- turn on one of your stove top elements on high, and put the frying pan on it. Now you gotta babysit it, grab a flipper and just keep checking the bottom, you want it to be crispy, partially burnt even in places, like you just keep checking it until the bottom looks like a proper ass pizza bottom. Once you think the bottom looks superb you turn OFF the burner. This should take like max 5 minutes.</p>
<p>So now you&#39;ve got the bottom of the crust perfect. So now you just dress your pizza like you normally would. put some sauce on it (I recommend PC tomato &amp; basil pasta sauce if you&#39;re lazy like me), then put your toppings on, then your cheese, then whatever, I like to dice up garlic and sprinkle that around. I also like some shredded parmasean or pecorino romano whatever that is. Also HIGHLY RECOMMEND some provolone cheese chunks (it makes the cheese thicker and better I think), ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you got perpperoni on there, you sprinly some fennel seeds on there, ye!!! Anyways top&#39;em up like you like.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pizza3.png" alt="Pizza ready to go"></p>
<p>Now make sure you have a rack on the top slot of your oven, and then crank on the BROIL, and put the pizza right under it. Now keep your EYE ON IT, it&#39;s quick. It will be like 3 minutes. Just keep opening the stove and pulling it out and checking. Eventually it will look like the best pizza you&#39;ve ever seen. When it looks like that then you are done. </p>

<p>Take it out and give it a few minutes to chill out, then chop it up and dig in bruh</p>
