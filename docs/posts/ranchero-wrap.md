So this is my take on an overpriced wrap I used to pay for almost weekly when working in office downtown. Place was called "Salad Bowl", the wrap is called the "Ranchero Wrap". This is my copycat recipe, feeds 2:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 large tortilla wraps
* 1 big or 2 small chicken breast
* 2 discs of red onion (more or less) diced
* half a tomato diced
* 1 avocado
* 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese
* iceberg lettuce (enough for 2 big macs) I measure iceberg lettuce in big macs
* tsp chilli powder
* ranch dressing or creaming dressing (pictured)
* optional - bacon crumble

**Pre-prep:**

* cube 1 big or 2 small chicken breast
* brown that in a non-stick in olive oil, salt, and pepper a couple hours before dinner, I usually do this at lunch.
* put it in a bowl or something covered with saran wrap, and put in the fridge to cool.

Whatever you do, just make sure the chicken is cold. This is a cold wrappopp buddy. You don't want no moist chicken chunks, it tastes like eating a petri dish.

So you and your chicken (c)hunks, you're almost done. 

**The prep:**

* throw down your tortilla wrap on some tinfoil if you fancy
* put half the chicken clumps down on each
* line with ranch dressing, or garlic parm dressing
* sprinkle a 1/2 tsp or so of chilli powder on each
* sprinkle half the cheese, half the tomato, the onion, lettuce, and avocado on each
* wrap'em up bro! **DONE**

If you're lucky it'll look something like this image I stole from google images:
