Not actually my grandma's recipe, but they encompass the best part about them, **YOU CANN RIP THEM APART WITHOUT A KNIFE YOU WEAK LOSER.**

yeah man, thats why I like them. I've seen them called pull-apart buns, or cloverleaf buns. anyways here's my recipe:

Get 2 big bowls

**In one bowl:**

* 3.5 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
* 1.5 teaspons salt
* mix that together

**In other bowl:**

* 2 tablespoons of sugar
* 2 teaspons of instant yeast - you can use active yeast or whatever too, this is just easier and what i have used
* 4 tablespoons of softened butter
* 1 cup + 2.5 tablespoons of Warm milk

Once you have the 2 bowls ready to go, start pouring the flour/salt bowl into the other bowl about a cup at a time and mixing with a wooden spoon or something. 

Once you have all the shit combined, just keep mixing with the wooden spoon until it's really sticky. 

Then wash your hands, roll up your sleeves, and put your hands in there and just keep rolling it around and folding it in on itself for like 5 minutes or until it looks and acts like dough. 

Wash the now empty bowl and dry it off, then grease it up with some butter or pam or something. 

Take your doughball and throw it in the greased bowl and put a damp dish drying towel over the bowl and put it somewhere warmish in your house. 

Let it sit for 60-90 minutes.

Grab a muffin tray (12 spots), grease up the holes by rubbing some margerine or butter around in them with parchment paper.

Take out your dough bowl and throw it down on a surface witha bit of flour, roll it around. 

Then you need to chop this focker up into 12 equally sized balls. I usually chop it into 3 equal pieces, then from each of those I chop them into 4. SO I have 12 ballssssss. Then I cut each in half, then each of those pieces i fold a bit into a ball. Then place 2 balss in each place in the muffin tray! 

Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls

Lay your dish towel on top of the rack and let it chill for another hour.

Preheat your oven to 350. Take off the towel and put the buns in the oven for 22 minutes.

Melt some butter, take the buns out and then brush some butter on top of them. **DONE**

Should look like this kinda but only 2 balls
